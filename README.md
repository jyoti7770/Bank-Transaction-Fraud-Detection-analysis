## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project focuses on analyzing bank transaction data to identify patterns, trends, and possible fraudulent activities.
Using Excel, Power Query, and visualization techniques, I derived insights that help to minimize fraud risks.

## DATASET
The dataset contains bank transaction records with details such as:
- Transaction ID

- Transaction Date

- Transaction Amount

- Customer ID

- Account Type

- State / Location

- Device Used

- Fraud Indicator (Fraud / Non-Fraud)

## OBJECTIVES
1. Analyze transaction patterns across customers, states, and devices.

2. Detect unusual patterns that may indicate fraudulent transactions.

3. Build dashboards.

## TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES
- Excel → Data cleaning, pivot analysis, fraud detection using slicers.
- Power Query → Data transformation and handling special characters.
- Power BI → Interactive dashboards and reports.

## KEY ANALYSIS
1. High-Value Transactions by Transaction type → help to find which transaction type involved more .

2. Fraud Percentage vs non fraud percentage → help to detect fraud percentage to reduce it by taking certain steps.

3. Fraud Percentage by Device → Identifying devices commonly used in fraud.

4. Top States by Fraud Rate → Highlighting regions with highest fraudulent activity.

5. fraud Percentage by Account type→ Checking, Business, Savings.
